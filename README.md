1. Analyzing Sales Performance
The project involves calculating important metrics like total revenue, average order value, and sales trends over time.

Queries can help identify best-selling pizzas, peak sales hours, and customer preferences (e.g., popular pizza sizes or toppings).

2. Data-Driven Decision Making
SQL queries help extract insights like monthly sales comparisons, customer ordering patterns, and pizza category performance (Veg vs. Non-Veg).

These insights assist pizza businesses in optimizing menus, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns for better profitability.
